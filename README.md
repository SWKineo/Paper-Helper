# Paper Helper (Invisible)

A simple extension for browsing and cleaning-up papers.

## Overview

Adds a right-click option to open the abstract and PDF for highlighted Arxiv ID's:

## Opening PDF's and abstracts

To open the PDF and abstract of a paper, highlight the ID, then right-click it and select 'Open PDF and abstract'. The extension filters text before the ID, so it's okay to include extra text on the same line (e.g. "Arxiv: .../##.##.gz"). The quickest way to use is to triple-click anything on the ID line, then right-click the whole selection:

(Also supports special topics, e.g. "Arxiv: 0306/hep-lat0306015.gz")

## Cleaning up paper formatting

To fix common formatting issues, click the extension icon ![inv-16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff069a31-0fbd-4ead-9114-c3401f153199) to open the cleanup tool. Paste raw paper contents in the top box, then a cleaned-up version will appear in the lower box.

It currently uses regular expressions to perform the following:

- removes surrounding text from the page (above and below the paper)

- removes unnecessary linebreaks;

- adds linebreaks around math mode ($$..$$) where applicable;

- replaces common unicode characters (currently 'â—»' and ' ') and unsupported/deprecated libraries (\mathpzc, \rm, \mbox)

I'll be expanding this as I clean up my own papers, so feel free to suggest new edits! Current regexes can be found in the `cleanUpPaper` function in `inv.paper-helper/popup.js`.
